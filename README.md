# Wallpaper
I created this wallpaper to work with wallpaper engine. 
Add a photo you prefer in this folder with the name background.jpg and that will be your wallpaper.
The CPU/GPU performance is quite nice, it takes on my laptop 2-5% power.

2. Add background.jpg
3. Open wallpaper engine
4. left bottom select own wallpaper
5. Select this wallpaper
